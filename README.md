## Sentiment Analysis Project
## Overview
This project performs sentiment analysis on text data using VADER and RoBERTa models. The aim is to classify the sentiment of given texts into positive, negative, or neutral categories by leveraging both rule-based and machine learning approaches.

## Structure
data/: Contains datasets used in the project.

notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks with the code and analysis.

src/: Source code for data processing and model implementation.

results/: Output files, plots, and model results.

README.md: Project overview and instructions.

requirements.txt: List of dependencies required to run the project.

##Installation
Clone the repository and install dependencies:

git clone https://github.com/KS-KARTHIK-05/sentimental-analysis.git
cd sentiment-analysis-project
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
Run the analysis by following the steps in the Jupyter notebooks or by executing the scripts in the src directory.

Example script to analyze sentiment:

from src.analyze_sentiment import analyze

data_path = 'data/sample_data.csv'
results = analyze(data_path)
print(results)

## Files
data/sample_data.csv: Example dataset.

notebooks/sentiment_analysis.ipynb: Notebook with analysis and visualizations.

src/analyze_sentiment.py: Main script for sentiment analysis.

requirements.txt: Dependencies for the project.

## Results
The results of the sentiment analysis, including visualizations and sentiment scores, can be found in the results/ directory.

## Visualizing Sentiment Scores
The following code snippet shows how to visualize the sentiment scores:

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Assuming results are in a DataFrame
fig, axs = plt.subplots(1, 3, figsize=(15, 5))
sns.barplot(data=results, x='Score', y='pos', ax=axs[0])
sns.barplot(data=results, x='Score', y='neu', ax=axs[1])
sns.barplot(data=results, x='Score', y='neg', ax=axs[2])
axs[0].set_title('Positive')
axs[1].set_title('Neutral')
axs[2].set_title('Negative')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
